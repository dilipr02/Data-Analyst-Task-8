# Data-Analyst-Task-8

Hi, I have completed the task 8 of Simple Sales Dashboard Design.

I have made the dashboard with 2019 superstore sales 
and have included the bar chart , line chart and donut chart for the visualization of sales over the category, region and month. 
The slicer visual for category.

The following are the insights of the dashboard

* December has the highest sales in west region in overall 2019 year.
* The Office Supplies has the highest sales in west region and december month.
* Technology has the second highest sales in west region and november month.
* Furniture has the average count of sales with west region and november and december months.
